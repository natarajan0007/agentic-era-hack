    # This job targets the 'production' environment, which is automatically
    # created by the Terraform setup in `deployment/terraform/github.tf`.
    # To enable manual approval for deployments, you must add a protection
    # rule to this environment in your GitHub repository settings.
    #
    # 1. Go to your repository's Settings > Environments.
    # 2. Select the 'production' environment.
    # 3. Under 'Protection rules', check the 'Required reviewers' box.
    # 4. Add the specific users or teams who must approve the deployment.
    #
    # Once configured, the workflow will pause at this step and wait for an
    # authorized user to approve it before proceeding.
