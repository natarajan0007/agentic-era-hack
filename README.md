### Agent Capabilities

The AURA agent has the following capabilities:

- **Read-only SQL Operations:** AURA can perform read-only operations on the database using the `toolbox` service. This includes:
    - Searching for tickets based on status, priority, assignee, or reporter.
    - Getting the details of a specific ticket.
    - Searching the knowledge base for articles.
    - Getting user details.

- **Write Operations:** AURA can create new tickets by interacting with the FastAPI backend via its OpenAPI schema. This is achieved using the `APIHubToolset` from the Google ADK.

## Important Notes

### Current Capabilities and Future Vision

The AURA agent is the cornerstone of the Intellica ITSM platform, and its capabilities are continuously evolving. This section outlines the agent's current functionality and provides a roadmap for its future development into a more powerful and comprehensive multi-agent system.

#### Current Architecture: A Read-Only Query Agent

At present, the AURA agent operates as a single agent focused on **read-only operations**. It can query the database to retrieve information about tickets, users, and knowledge base articles. This allows the agent to answer questions and provide information to users.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Current Architecture"
        A[User] --> B(AURA Agent - Read Only);
        B --> C{Database};
    end
```

#### Future Vision: A Multi-Agent System for Proactive IT Operations

The future of the Intellica platform lies in a **multi-agent architecture**, where specialized agents work together to automate and streamline IT operations. This vision extends beyond simple query-answering and aims to create a proactive and intelligent ITSM solution.

**Key future enhancements include:**

*   **Multi-Agent Search Agent:** The single AURA agent will be replaced by a **Multi-Agent Search Agent**. This will be a sophisticated agent that can understand complex user queries and route them to the appropriate specialized agent (e.g., L1 Agent, L2 Agent). This search agent will be powered by **Vertex AI Search**, which will enable it to search through a vast knowledge base of technical and non-technical documents, providing more accurate and context-aware answers to end-users.

*   **Connectors for External Tools:** To integrate with a wide range of external tools, we will develop a system of **Connectors**. These connectors will act as a bridge between the multi-agent system and various IT Ops and monitoring tools. Each connector will be responsible for translating the agent's requests into the specific API calls required by the external tool and returning the results in a format that the agent can understand.

*   **Mission Control Platform (MCP):** The entire multi-agent system will be orchestrated by a **Mission Control Platform (MCP)**. The MCP will be responsible for managing the lifecycle of the agents, routing requests between them, and providing a centralized point of control and monitoring for the entire system.

*   **Single Pane of Glass for Engineers:** By consolidating information and actions from multiple tools into a single interface, the multi-agent system will serve as a **"single pane of glass"** for engineers. This will eliminate the need for engineers to switch between different tools and dashboards, significantly improving their efficiency and reducing the cognitive load.

## Demo

Due to time constraints during the hackathon, the full end-to-end demo is not currently functional. However, the individual services can be tested, and the `toolbox` service, which is crucial for the agent's functionality, can be tested locally.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud SDK
- Terraform
- Docker
- Python 3.12
- Node.js

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/natarajan0007/agentic-era-hack.git
    cd agentic-era-hack
    ```

2.  **Set up the infrastructure:**
    - Navigate to the `infrastructure/terraform/staging` directory.
    - Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`.

3.  **Deploy the services:**
    - The services are deployed automatically via the GitHub Actions workflow when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## Local Development

To run the services locally for development and testing, follow these instructions.

### Backend (`fastapi-backend`)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd services/fastapi-backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9090
    ```

### ADK Agent (`adk-agent`)

1.  **Navigate to the agent directory:**
    ```bash
    cd services/adk-agent
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8010
    ```

### Frontend (`nextjs-frontend`)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd services/nextjs-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Toolbox (`toolbox`)

The `toolbox` service can be tested locally using Docker Compose.

1.  **Navigate to the toolbox directory:**
    ```bash
    cd services/toolbox(localtesting)
    ```

2.  **Run the service:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    This will start the `toolbox` service, which the `adk-agent` can then connect to for local testing.

## Backend Scripts

The `services/fastapi-backend/scripts/` directory contains several scripts for initializing and seeding the database.

-   **`init.sql`:** This SQL script creates the initial departments in the database. It's a simple way to ensure that the basic department structure is in place when the database is first created.

-   **`seed_departments.py`:** This Python script also creates the initial departments. It's a more robust way to seed the data, as it can be run from the command line and can include more complex logic if needed.

-   **`seed_users.py`:** This script creates a set of users with different roles (e.g., admin, L1 engineer, L2 engineer, end-user) and a defined reporting structure. This is useful for testing the application with a realistic set of users.

-   **`seed_tickets.py`:** This script creates a set of random IT tickets and assigns them to the seeded users. This is useful for populating the database with realistic ticket data for testing and demonstration purposes.

-   **`assign_tickets.py`:** This script assigns all open tickets to L1 and L2 engineers. This is useful for simulating the ticket assignment process.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The application is deployed using a CI/CD pipeline defined in the `.github/workflows` directory.

- **Staging Deployment:** The staging environment is deployed automatically on every push to the `main` branch. The workflow will build and push the container images to Google Artifact Registry and then deploy the services to Google Cloud Run.

- **Production Deployment:** The production deployment is a manual process that can be triggered from the GitHub Actions UI. Once the changes in the staging environment have been verified, you can navigate to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository, select the "Deploy to Prod" workflow, and run it. This will deploy the latest version of the `main` branch to the production environment.
